"Lua is a powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language." 
This extension embeds the lua interpreter and offers an OO-API to lua variables and functions.

--------

This branch contains some slight modifications which allow use on Debian/Ubuntu, which places
its lua libraries in a non-standard location (and gives the libraries a nonstandard name).

To use on Debian/Ubuntu, provide the --with-lua-version flag while configuring:

phpize
./configure --with-lua-version=5.2
